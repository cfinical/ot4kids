					<h2> What Is Sensory Integration Therapy?</h2>
					<p>Sensory Integration therapy is a specific and individualized treatment program for children with sensory processing disorders. Everyday, we gain sensory experiences through touch, movement, body awareness, sight, sound, and the pull of gravity. Sensory integration is the brain’s ability to organize and interpret sensory information we receive to use it in a meaningful way. This provides the foundation for later, more complex, learning and behavior.

						<h3>What does Fine Motor mean?</h3>
						<p>“Fine motor” refers to the movements we make with the small muscles of the hands. Children start to use their hands right at birth to explore their own bodies and the world around them.

						<h3>How we evaluate your child? </h3>
						<p>“OT 4 Kid’s occupational therapists are trained to assess your childs fine motor skills compared to where they should be based on their peers. A child’s handwriting assessment is comprehensive; it includes identifying his current level of functioning in the areas of visual skills, ocular motor skills, body awareness, fine motor planning, shoulder stability, and hand and finger strength. To do this, our therapists will discuss the child’s performance with the parents and teachers, perform standardized assessments, obtain a handwriting sample and observe the child’s fine and gross motor movement patterns. This handwriting assessment allows the therapist to identify the child’s strengths and weaknesses in these skills areas and reveal the source of his difficulty with handwriting.
						</p>

						<p> Following the handwriting assessment, the therapist will develop goals based on the child’s performance and design a treatment program that concentrates on improving these foundational skills. Treatment for handwriting difficulty may include the Handwriting Without Tears ® program, sensorimotor strategies, strengthening the intrinsic muscles of the hand, compensatory strategies such as pencil grips or writing paper with visual cues, and ergonomic strategies such as a slant board or the child’s positioning at the desk.

						<h3>What Does Gross Motor Mean? </h3>
						<p>Gross Motor Skills are skills that develop through using the large muscles of the body in a coordinated and controlled way. We receive sensory information from our bodies and the environment through our sensory systems (vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, vestibular, and proprioception). This sensory information then needs to be organized and processed to be able to produce an appropriate motor or movement response for success in daily tasks at home or at school. Gross motor skills develop through practice and repetition, which is why a baby takes weeks to perfect the art of rolling, sitting or crawling.

					<h3>What Does Ocular Motor Mean?</h3>
					<p>Ocular motor (oculomotor) control and visual perception are foundational skills necessary for a variety of daily activities, including, but not limited to reading, writing, catching, throwing, organization, and safety when navigating environments. Occupational therapists are trained to identify and treat difficulties related to visual perception and ocular motor control in order to facilitate participation and engagement in meaningful activities.
					</p>
					<p> Ocular motor muscles, much like the small muscles in our hands and fingers, work together to control eye movements and facilitate eye teaming (the ability of our eyes to work together in a coordinated fashion). Our eyes must work together to complete smooth tracking movements (such as tracking words across a page as you read) and convergence/divergence movements (such as used when looking up and back down to copy information from the board). Impairments in ocular motor control (often stemming from muscle weakness, vestibular processing challenges, or injury or dysfunction within the central nervous system) can directly influence a child’s ability to accurately perceive and receive visual information. 
					</p>
					<p>Visual perception describes the ability to perceive and interpret visual information. Visual perception includes many components, including visual discrimination, visual-spatial awareness, figure-ground perception, form constancy, and visual memory, to name a few. Challenges in this area are often associated with learning difficulties in reading, writing, math, and spelling. Other daily activities, such as grooming and dressing, play activities, and athletic performance, are also frequently affected. Visual perception and ocular motor skills are evaluated through standardized assessments and various clinical observations. Following evaluation, a specific treatment plan is created to address a child’s unique needs. Ocular motor control and visual perception skills can be addressed through a variety of therapeutic interventions.

					<p> Ocular motor muscles, much like the small muscles in our hands and fingers, work together to control eye movements and facilitate eye teaming (the ability of our eyes to work together in a coordinated fashion). Our eyes must work together to complete smooth tracking movements (such as tracking words across a page as you read) and convergence/divergence movements (such as used when looking up and back down to copy information from the board). Impairments in ocular motor control (often stemming from muscle weakness, vestibular processing challenges, or injury or dysfunction within the central nervous system) can directly influence a child’s ability to accurately perceive and receive visual information. 
					</p>
					<img class="imgSizer" src="_imgs/ocularMotor_mobileImg.jpg">
					<p>Visual perception describes the ability to perceive and interpret visual information. Visual perception includes many components, including visual discrimination, visual-spatial awareness, figure-ground perception, form constancy, and visual memory, to name a few. Challenges in this area are often associated with learning difficulties in reading, writing, math, and spelling. Other daily activities, such as grooming and dressing, play activities, and athletic performance, are also frequently affected. Visual perception and ocular motor skills are evaluated through standardized assessments and various clinical observations. Following evaluation, a specific treatment plan is created to address a child’s unique needs. Ocular motor control and visual perception skills can be addressed through a variety of therapeutic interventions.

						<h3>What Do We Mean By Social Skills?</h3>
						<p>When we refers to "Social Skills" we are talking about the ability for your child to interact with other people and to understand and control their own emotions. Babies start to develop relationships with the people around them right from birth, but the process of learning to communicate, share, and interact with others take many years to develop. Developing the ability to control your emotions and behavior is also a long process. Children continue to develop their social-eotional skills well into their teenage years, or even young adulthood. </p>

						<h3>What Our Training Entails? </h3>
						<p>Our social skills training and curriculums are designed from evidenced based practice methods and procedures. Social skills principles are taught based on the individuals and groups needs, and incorporate sensory based and kinesthetic based learning principles for improved skill acquisition. Curriculums typically last anywhere from 6-12 weeks in length and are supported by caregiver education, off-site fieldtrips to help generalize skills learned in the classroom, and ongoing assessment of each child's abilities. Past curriculums have included: Social Thinking (Zones of Regulation, SuperFlex, The Incredible Flexible You, Whole Body Listening Larry, Social Detective), the PEERS Program, ICPS-I Can Problem Solve, Skillstreaming in Early Childhood, Elementary, and Adolescent, Stop & Think, The Accepts Program, and The Prepare Program.

						<h3>What Does Executive Functioning Mean? </h3>
						<p>Executive functions are the decision-making processes that include planning, organizing, sequencing, strategizing, and response inhibition, sustained attention, time management, flexibility and remembering details. Executive functions are required at the onset of a task or when a novel task is presented. They are needed to organize one’s thoughts and actions in order to create a plan and execute the plan. In addition, executive functions help with self-regulation, which is the ability to monitor one’s behaviors. Improving self-regulatory processes will increase executive control, which together, are central to cognitive, linguistic, behavioral, and affective control—all of which are fundamental to learning and success in school.

						<h3>What Is Oral Motor Mean?</h3>
						<p>
						Oral-motor skills refer to the movement of the muscles of the face. This includes muscle tone, muscle strength, range of motion, speed, coordination, and dissociation. Clinical experience suggests that the acquisition and maturation of oral-motor movements underlies sound production and feeding skills (e.g., sucking, biting, and chewing). Feeding issues in children are often secondary to early medical issues, unidentified muscle weakness or motor planning, or underlying sensory processing deficits. The longer children's feeding deficits persist without intervention, the more likely that behaviors and habits will set in, causing further complications.

						<h3>How We Treat Your Child</h3>
						<p>
						At OT 4 Kids we use a variety of developmental and muscle-based oral motor, feeding, and swallowing techniques. This allows the child the opportunities to build strength and coordination of their oral motor structures, while interacting with food in a playful manner. This approach not only increases their comfort and willingness to explore and manage more foods, but also increases their sensory tolerance. Some of our techniques derive from the following: Beckman Oral Motor Program, The S.O.S. Approach to Feeding Model, Baby Led Weaning Techniques, The Get Permission Approach, and Swallowing Assessment and Intervention.
